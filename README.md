<h2>Abstract</h2>

Virtual reality (VR) as a concept has been around for years, primarily through popular culture in science fiction novels and films such as Snow Crash, The Matrix, and even as early back as the 1930s with The Man Who Awoke. However, the technology has been too expensive for it to really become commonplace. Today we live in a society where we have developed technology enough to allow VR to be affordable and accessible enough to the public that applications for it are actually sought after. Landscaping VR is a dive into some of the possibilities afforded by the unique design space VR offers. There are two modes in the application. The editor mode, allows the user to create their own landscape design from a gods-eye view using the tools available. Once they are satisfied with their creation, they can shrink down into an exploration mode to see what their given landscape might look like from a human scale, then, conversely, grow back to the original size to alter their creation. It is a sandbox application in nature that takes advantage of motion control input and the unique perspective into virtual worlds.
